## Notes
- Outputs are always **readable**, **concise**, and **action-oriented**.
- For security, keep API keys and tokens out of the repo. Use environment variables (e.g., `.env` or your hosting provider‚Äôs **Environment Variables**) and ignore sensitive files like `agent/token.json`.
- Thanks to the **ag-ui protocol**, you can interact with agents and see **live updates** directly in the interface.


## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API Key (for the Agno agent)
- Any of the following package managers:
  - pnpm (recommended)
  - npm
  - yarn
  - bun

> **Note:** This repository ignores lock files (package-lock.json, yarn.lock, pnpm-lock.yaml, bun.lockb) to avoid conflicts between different package managers. Each developer should generate their own lock file using their preferred package manager. After that, make sure to delete it from the .gitignore.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies using your preferred package manager:
```bash
# Using pnpm (recommended)
pnpm install

# Using npm
npm install

# Using yarn
yarn install

# Using bun
bun install
```

> **Note:** Installing the package dependencies will also install the agent's python dependencies via the `install:agent` script.

2. Set up your OpenAI API key:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key-here"
```

or create a `.env` file.

```bash
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here" > agent/.env
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
# Using pnpm
pnpm dev

# Using npm
npm run dev

# Using yarn
yarn dev

# Using bun
bun run dev
```

This will start both the UI and agent servers concurrently.

## Available Scripts
The following scripts can also be run using your preferred package manager:
- `dev` - Starts both UI and agent servers in development mode
- `dev:debug` - Starts development servers with debug logging enabled
- `dev:ui` - Starts only the Next.js UI server
- `dev:agent` - Starts only the Agno agent server
- `build` - Builds the Next.js application for production
- `start` - Starts the production server
- `lint` - Runs ESLint for code linting
- `install:agent` - Installs Python dependencies for the agent
