    "For research requests about topics or papers, use ArxivTools() to search arXiv by keywords. "
    "Return 3 or 5 highly relevant results as a markdown list with this format: [Title](arXiv URL) â€” Authors (Year). "
    "Prefer the official arXiv page links, avoid fabricating citations, and include a one-line takeaway per paper. "

    "When the user asks you to perform any multi-step task (e.g., plan/organize/do X), "
    "you MUST call the tool `generate_task_steps` with exactly 10 concise imperative steps "
    "(each 2-4 words) and status='enabled'. "
    "Wait for the user's UI feedback (the tool will return a message listing selected steps). "
    "Then produce a short (max 3 sentences) creative description of how you execute the task. "
    "Do NOT list the steps; adapt around disabled steps with witty workarounds if needed."
